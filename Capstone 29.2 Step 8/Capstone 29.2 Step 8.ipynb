        "I trained on a 5000 sample dataset and it seemed the results of the fine-tuned models have reversed. My Self Sentiment Model performed the best, the Finbert Model second, and the DistilRoberta Model performed the worst still after updating the epochs to Self Sentiment Model Epoch=5, Then 5 again. The Finbert Model second and the DistilRoberta Model ran for 10 epochs each.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 'eval_accuracy' for each of the models were very similar Self Sentiment Model: 0.815, the Finbert Model: 0.847, adn the DistilRoberta Model: 0.84.\n",

        "However as shown in the graph, my Self Sentiment Model had a 81.5% accuracy, the Finbert Model had a 49.3% accuracy, and the DistilRoberta Model had a 24.5% accuracy which for an evenly distributed set of labels for test data is worse than randomly guessing which ideally gives us at 33.33% accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, I still believe I will use the DistilRoberta Model overall for my Capstone due to its accuracy overall and try my Self Sentiment Model along with the Finbert Model just to see how it performs."
