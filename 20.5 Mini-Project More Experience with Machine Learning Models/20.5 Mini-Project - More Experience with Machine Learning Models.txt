Mini-Project: More Experience With Machine Learning Models

In this colab notebook, you will build and evaluate several machine learning models using Python's popular data science libraries, such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy. 
You will start by loading a real-world dataset and preparing it for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. 
Then, you will build several machine learning models, including a baseline, and evaluate their performance using common evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
